Open the app.config and enter you game name.

Run the console application. It will go check in the app.config. The firs time
your Twitter key will not be there and will launch a webpage requesting you

Once accepted, it will write your key to communicate into the app.config.

Every game played will create a replay file. The console application detect
the replay file and analyse it with the Starcraft2.ReplayParser. You can find
